# What is ShadeJS?

ShadeJS is a typescript SDK for interacting with <a href="https://shadeprotocol.io/" target="_blank">Shade Protocol</a> and <a href="https://scrt.network/" target="_blank">Secret Network</a> smart contracts. It is designed as a wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret.js" target="_blank">Secret.js</a> and abstracts the complexity of secret client management (for queries), as well as providing simple-to-use typescript interfaces for the inputs and outputs of contracts. In addition, it implements multi-query optimizations in order to obtain large on-chain data sets in a highly efficient manner.

## Out of Scope
In its current state, ShadeJS does NOT include services to execute contracts via a <a href="https://secretjs.scrt.network/#integrations" target="_blank">Secret Signing Client.</a> This is because signing transactions requires a complex integration with multiple types of wallets. However, ShadeJS DOES include message creator functions for executions that can be easily imported into your project, so that you can call them from your own signing client manager.
